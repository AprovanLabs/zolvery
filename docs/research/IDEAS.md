🧮 Sum It Up
Concept:
Wordplay meets arithmetic: Find letter-based equations hidden in a grid.

How It Works:
You're given a 4x4 grid of letters

Each letter has a hidden point value (like Scrabble)

Your task: Select words that sum to the target number

Example:
Target Sum: 24
Grid: S, U, M, E, T, R, A, D, C, O, L, E, N, B, I, T
Find 3 words where their total letter values = 24

Points:

Longer words = fewer moves

Bonus for themed words

Why It Works:
Crosses Spelling Bee with number puzzle appeal

Can theme puzzles for added challenge (e.g., "Science terms")
