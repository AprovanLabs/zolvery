Generate an icon for an online version of a board game. Do this in a very simple, bold style that is SVG-like. The design should primarily be black and white lines/backgrounds with a pop of a single color, preferring those from Tailwind.

The design should be simplistic with blocky lines and easily-viewable at small sizes.

Create a grid of variations on the design. Use the attached icon as inspiration for design format and style.
